# Next.js Migration Instructions

Since we couldn't modify the protected `tsconfig.json` file, follow these instructions to complete the migration:

1. Add the following scripts to your package.json:
   ```
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "next dev",
     "build": "next build",
     "start": "next start"
   }
   ```

2. Add the `.client` directive to all component files to ensure proper client-side rendering.

3. The migration creates a hybrid structure that works with both old files and new Next.js app router.

4. To run the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Important: You may need to manually add "use client" directive to other component files if they use client-side features and aren't already listed.
